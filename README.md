### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Habibatallah amr, and I am a highly motivated and passionate computer science professional with a deep love for programming and technology. I study CompSci, which has given me a strong foundation in the fundamental principles of software development, algorithms, and data structures.
I'm proficient in languages such as Java, C++, Python and JavaScript.

I'm currently a full stack developer intern, and this internship has helped me learn more about the web, by working on real-time systems. 
and I'm currently learning new languages such as Ruby and Golang. I'm also learning more about threading, concurrency, etc.
